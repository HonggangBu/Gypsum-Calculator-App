We noticed that your app or its metadata includes irrelevant third-party platform information. 

Specifically, your app includes references to Android in the metadata Description.

Referencing third-party platforms in your app or its metadata is not permitted on the App Store unless there is specific interactive functionality.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please remove all instances of this information from your app and its metadata, including the app description, What's New info, previews, and screenshots.

Since your iTunes Connect status is Metadata Rejected, we do NOT require a new binary. To revise the metadata, visit iTunes Connect to select your app and revise the desired metadata values. Once you¡¯ve completed all changes, reply to this message in Resolution Center and we will continue the review.

NOTE: Please be sure to make any metadata changes to all app localizations by selecting each specific localization and making appropriate changes.
